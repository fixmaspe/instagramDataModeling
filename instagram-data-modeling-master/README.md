# Create the database model for Instagram

Inside he `src/models.py` file you will find a couple of classes describing an example database.

Here is a 4min video explaining what UML is: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6lqHOVHic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6lqHOVHic)

We are going to be creating the Entity Relationship Diagram for Instagram Database, a very similar diagram to this one:

## 💻 Instalation

1. Get inside the environment `$ pipenv shell`

2. Install all dependencies `$ pipenv install`

3. Generate de diagram as many times as you need `$ python src/models.py`

4. Open the file `diagram.png` to check out your UML diagram!


## 📝Instructions

Your Job is to update the `src/models.py` file with the code needed to replicate the instagram data model.

The project is using the SQLAlchemy Python library to generate the database.

- What tables do you think instagram might have on its database: E.g: Post, User, etc.?
- What properties should go inside the user? or inside the Post table?
- Please add at least 4 models with all of its properties.
- Degenerate the diagram.png file at the end by running `$ python3 models.py` on the console.
